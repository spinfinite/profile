		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			I have been playing music since very little. The earliest memory I have is when I was about 3 years old and was given a drum that I would sing songs with. My grandpa died soon after but it has been said that he died singing the songs I used to drum to and sing.</p>
		<p>
			Today, I strive to make songs to uplift and have a positive outcome. The music has evolved and the goal is much more defined. I go by the name of Sergio Andres, The S.E.R. which stands for Science Expressed through Rhymes. Many of my friends know me by that name and you may hear me say “The S.E.R. baby!”

			Sergio
